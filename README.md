# Welcome to Molly (Work in progress)
[![Build and Test](https://github.com/Veil43/molly/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Veil43/molly/actions/workflows/build.yml)

Molly is a learning project aimed to speed up my investingation into different computer graphics techniques.
For now the renderer remains a very early a work in progress and supports the bare minimum for 3D visualisation.

So far the supported features are, glTF asset importing and Phong Lighting. 
I am in the process of implementing a lightweight asset manager and caching system to speed up asset import times.

### Build instructions
The project is currently too unsteable for me to reliably list instruction for building on other machines.
